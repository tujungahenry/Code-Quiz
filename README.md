### From scratch, build a timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side. Following the common templates for user stories, we can frame this challenge as follows:

#### User will have 10 seconds to answer each question. For every answer that is right you will get a green light and for every answer that is wrong you will get a red light! At the end of the quiz a percentage score will generate. Also you may enter and record your intials and scores to keep track of your history and others check other players history.
